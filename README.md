# blkstuff
A .blk decryptor and mhy0 extractor for Genshin Impact that doesn't require hooking into the game. Tested working as of 2.0.

The code isn't very good, but it's meant as more of a reference than an actual tool. Any efforts to rewrite the project are highly appreciated.

## NOTES
I **copied(stole)** some of AssetStudios stuff to work freely on mac and use from a cli. i made 1% of the AssetExtractor folder.
